/* The ThrottleGroup structure (with its ThrottleState) is shared
 * among different BlockBackends and it's independent from
 * AioContext, so in order to use it from different threads it needs
 * its own locking.
 *
 * This locking is however handled internally in this file, so it's
 * transparent to outside users.
 *
 * The whole ThrottleGroup structure is private and invisible to
 * outside users, that only use it through its ThrottleState.
 *
 * In addition to the ThrottleGroup structure, BlockBackendPublic has
 * fields that need to be accessed by other members of the group and
 * therefore also need to be protected by this lock. Once a
 * BlockBackend is registered in a group those fields can be accessed
 * by other threads any time.
 *
 * Again, all this is handled internally and is mostly transparent to
 * the outside. The 'throttle_timers' field however has an additional
 * constraint because it may be temporarily invalid (see for example
 * bdrv_set_aio_context()). Therefore in this file a thread will
 * access some other BlockBackend's timers only after verifying that
 * that BlockBackend has throttled requests in the queue.
